    <h1>This font is Bree Serif!</h1>
    <p>This font is Lato. These two fonts work well together especially because Bree Serif is a flashier font, while Lato is very plain. Bree Serif is also a heavier serif font, while Lato is sans serif and generally lighter, and I thought that the contrast worked well between them. Bree Serif does a good job of establishing itself as a header font, especially in comparison to Lato. I also considered using an even flashier and more exciting font as a header, because I love fonts like that, but I figured that if I were to be actually presenting historical information online, it would be better to err on the side of caution in regards to presentation, intended audience, and professionalism.</p>
    <h1>This is an example of good colour choice. </h1>
    <p>These colours are all cool colours, providing a sense of calmness. This would be good for academic material as it would not distract from the content of the material. The green header font, analogous to the blue, provides more of a pop than two different shades of blue for the background and paragraph text, emphasizing it as a header. As well, according to the colour psychology website linked in the exercise, blue is a productive colour, which would be good for academic or professional material.</p>
