    <h1>This font is Bree Serif!</h1>
    <p>This font is Lato. These two fonts work well together especially because Bree Serif is a flashier font, while Lato is very plain. Bree Serif is also a heavier serif font, while Lato is sans serif and generally lighter, and I thought that the contrast worked well between them. Bree Serif does a good job of establishing itself as a header font, especially in comparison to Lato. I also considered using an even flashier and more exciting font as a header, because I love fonts like that, but I figured that if I were to be actually presenting historical information online, it would be better to err on the side of caution in regards to presentation, intended audience, and professionalism.</p>
    <h1>This is an example of poor colour choice. </h1>
    <p>The colours do not work well together, especially within the context of a webpage. As a presentation of information, it is not pleasing on the eyes, nor does it provide any sense of authority or expertise. The bright colours detract from the information, and they all contrast and fight for attention instead of working together.They also look childish and certainly would not be an appropriate combination for any sort of professional or academic work. If I am being honest, the combination is probably something I would have come up with when I learned very basic html at age 8.</p>
